# Space_2D_Shotting_Game

The reason I make this game is because I wanted to practice my programming skills as well as to learn the basics of Python.
But I must clarify that this project was not made by me from scratch. I used a YouTube toturial video as reference, and not much changes had been made.
I will place the link down below.

This game is about avoiding crashing into asteroids and survive as long as you can.
Player can control the spaceship by using wasd key and shot bullet with spacebar on the keyboard.

I hope I can also add more function into the game such as: online/local multi-player(coop or competitive), scoreboard, level system(maybe can earn customizable abilities as the level go up).
